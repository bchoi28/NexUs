# MVP Features

### Profiles

From the splash, users have the option to sign-up as a new user, or login as a demo user. NexUs's authentication process is complete with custom error handling and a multi-step sign-up form very similar to LinkedIn's. 
Upon sign-up/sign-in, a user can update profile demographics and photos (see [AWS](#aws)).

### Posts/Comments/Likes

Users can utilize full CRUD functionality for posts, comments, and likes, with update/delete restricted to only the logged-in user's content. Posts are rendered on the feed page using infinite scroll/lazy loading technology.

### Alliances

Users can form professional alliances across the multiverse by sending/accepting alliance requests to other users. A user will be able to message another once an alliance has been formed (see [WebSocket](#websocket-api)).

### Experiences

Users can add, view, update, or delete experiences displayed on their profile pages. 

### Search

Users can utilize a search bar with auto-complete implementation to find users across NexUs.

### AWS

NexUs optimizes Amazon S3 for profile pictures, cover photos, and post images, ensuring seamless storage, retrieval, and updates. A reliable and secure solution, S3 empowers users to effortlessly share and manage their visual content within the platform.

# Future Functionalities

#### WebSocket API
* Users will be able to carry private conversations with their alliances utilizing WebSocket API.

#### Expanded Post Functionality
* Users will be able to repost others' posts and embed videos on their posts.
