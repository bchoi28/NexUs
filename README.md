# MVP Features

## Profiles

From the splash, users have the option to sign-up as a new user, or login as a demo user. NexUs's authentication process is complete with custom error handling and a multi-step sign-up form very similar to LinkedIn's. 
Upon sign-up/sign-in, a user can update profile demographics and photos (see [AWS](#aws)).

## Posts/Comments/Likes

Users can utilize full CRUD functionality for posts, comments, and likes, with update/delete restricted to only the logged-in user's content. Posts are rendered on the feed page using infinite scroll/lazy loading technology.

## Alliances

## Experiences

## Search

## AWS

NexUs optimizes Amazon S3 for profile pictures, cover photos, and post images, ensuring seamless storage, retrieval, and updates. A reliable and secure solution, S3 empowers users to effortlessly share and manage their visual content within the platform."

## Future Functionalities

#### Expanded Search Capability
* Users will be able to utilize a search bar during the itinerary creation process to search by any desired keyword.
* Users will have the option to view the next 3 activities if they did not like any of the first set of suggestions.
